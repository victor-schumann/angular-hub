<!-- 
The goal of this log is to be a proof of comcept of the YUGIOH framework when applied to an educational coding course in video. The framework is:
YUGIOH - "Yank, Understand, Graph, Implement, Optimize, Hone"
    Yank: Gather all necessary information about the problem.
    Understand: Understand the requirements and constraints of the issue.
    Graph: Draw or write down an algorithm to solve the problem.
    Implement: Write code to implement the algorithm.
    ptimize: Optimize the code to improve performance and/or readability.
    Hone: Review and hone the solution to ensure it meets the requirements and is free of bugs.

# Services
Services in Angular are classes that can be used to share data or functionality across multiple components or modules. They are typically used for tasks that are not specific to a particular component, such as data retrieval, logging, or authentication.

Services are often used to implement the business logic of an application. They can interact with APIs, perform data transformations, or implement complex algorithms.

To use a service in a component, you need to inject it into the component's constructor using Angular's dependency injection system. This allows the component to access the service's properties and methods.

Services are a key part of Angular's architecture and promote a modular, reusable approach to building applications. By separating concerns into services, you can make your application more testable, maintainable, and scalable.

    Here I will write down all the information displayed in the section, similar to an algorithm so I can go through the steps later with a better understanding of the big picture.
